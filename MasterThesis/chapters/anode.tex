\chapter{Anomaly Detection with Density Estimation (ANODE)}
\label{chap:anode}
short intro heres
refer to section of general NN stuff
continue with more on target things
difficulty in estimating densities in high dim


\section{Normalizing Flows}
\label{sec:snormFlow}
general idea show flow from complex to simple
can evaluate density of a gaussian
choose tractable transformations so change of variables can be performed
now I know which density complex is

need to find the transformations that do this
interpret output as shift and scale parameters that transform input
easy peasy jacobian


\subsection{Masked Autoencoders for Density Estimation}
\label{ssec:made}
computational efficiency \cite{Alman.12.10.2020}
make use of multiplication rule of probability
do I need to explain conditional probability?
make a figure that actually shows how I do the masking
