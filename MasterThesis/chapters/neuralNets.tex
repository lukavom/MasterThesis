\section{Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neurals}
inspired by natural neurons
start with basic feed forward nets
basic usage: dimensionality reduction
	use high dimensional output that contains information pertaining an event
	get output in a single (or few) dimensions
	
example classifier
example autoencoder

backpropagation

activation functions

weights
bias

computational expense needs to be considered
improvements in hardware made this field grow rapidly 

deep learning only possible with some additional requirements, such as batch normalization

make clear what I call "Normalizing flow", maybe better somewhere else
